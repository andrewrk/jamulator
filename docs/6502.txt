6502 Microprocessor

 Revision 1.02 by _Bnu.

 Most of the following information has been taking out of the "Commodore 64
Programmers Reference Manual" simply because it was available in electronic
form and there appears to be no difference between this documentation and
the 6502 documentation, they are both from the 6500 family after all. I've
made changes and additions where appropriate.

 In theory you should be able to use any code you can find for emulating
the 6510 (the C64 processor).



  THE REGISTERS INSIDE THE 6502 MICROPROCESSOR

    Almost all calculations are done in the microprocessor. Registers are
  special pieces of memory in the processor which are used to carry out, and
  store information about calculations. The 6502 has the following registers:


  THE ACCUMULATOR

    This is THE most important register in the microprocessor. Various ma-
  chine language instructions allow you to copy the contents of a memory
  location into the accumulator, copy the contents of the accumulator into
  a memory location, modify the contents of the accumulator or some other
  register directly, without affecting any memory. And the accumulator is
  the only register that has instructions for performing math.


  THE X INDEX REGISTER

    This is a very important register. There are instructions for nearly
  all of the transformations you can make to the accumulator. But there are
  other instructions for things that only the X register can do. Various
  machine language instructions allow you to copy the contents of a memory
  location into the X register, copy the contents of the X register into a
  memory location, and modify the contents of the X, or some other register
  directly.


  THE Y INDEX REGISTER

    This is a very important register. There are instructions for nearly
  all of the transformations you can make to the accumulator, and the X
  register. But there are other instructions for things that only the Y
  register can do. Various machine language instructions allow you to copy
  the contents of a memory location into the Y register, copy the contents
  of the Y register into a memory location, and modify the contents of the
  Y, or some other register directly.


  THE STATUS REGISTER

    This register consists of eight "flags" (a flag = something that indi-
  cates whether something has, or has not occurred). Bits of this register
  are altered depending on the result of arithmetic and logical operations.
  These bits are described below:

     Bit No.       7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
                   S   V       B   D   I   Z   C

   Bit0 - C - Carry flag: this holds the carry out of the most significant
   bit in any arithmetic operation. In subtraction operations however, this
   flag is cleared - set to 0 - if a borrow is required, set to 1 - if no
   borrow is required. The carry flag is also used in shift and rotate
   logical operations.

   Bit1 - Z - Zero flag: this is set to 1 when any arithmetic or logical
   operation produces a zero result, and is set to 0 if the result is
   non-zero.

   Bit 2 - I: this is an interrupt enable/disable flag. If it is set,
   interrupts are disabled. If it is cleared, interrupts are enabled.

   Bit 3 - D: this is the decimal mode status flag. When set, and an Add with
   Carry or Subtract with Carry instruction is executed, the source values are
   treated as valid BCD (Binary Coded Decimal, eg. 0x00-0x99 = 0-99) numbers.
   The result generated is also a BCD number.

   Bit 4 - B: this is set when a software interrupt (BRK instruction) is
   executed.

   Bit 5: not used. Supposed to be logical 1 at all times.

   Bit 6 - V - Overflow flag: when an arithmetic operation produces a result
   too large to be represented in a byte, V is set.

   Bit 7 - S - Sign flag: this is set if the result of an operation is
   negative, cleared if positive.

   The most commonly used flags are C, Z, V, S.

  

  THE PROGRAM COUNTER

    This contains the address of the current machine language instruction
  being executed. Since the operating system is always "RUN"ning in the
  Commodore VIC-20 (or, for that matter, any computer), the program counter
  is always changing. It could only be stopped by halting the microprocessor
  in some way.


  THE STACK POINTER

    This register contains the location of the first empty place on the
  stack. The stack is used for temporary storage by machine language pro-
  grams, and by the computer.




  ADDRESSING MODES

   Instructions need operands to work on. There are various ways of
  indicating where the processor is to get these operands. The different
  methods used to do this are called addressing modes. The 6502 offers 11
  modes, as described below.

  1) Immediate
  In this mode the operand's value is given in the instruction itself. In
  assembly language this is indicated by "#" before the operand.
  eg.  LDA #$0A - means "load the accumulator with the hex value 0A"
  In machine code different modes are indicated by different codes. So LDA
  would be translated into different codes depending on the addressing mode.
  In this mode, it is: $A9 $0A

  2 & 3) Absolute and Zero-page Absolute
  In these modes the operands address is given.
  eg.  LDA $31F6 - (assembler)
       $AD $31F6 - (machine code)
  If the address is on zero page - i.e. any address where the high byte is
  00 - only 1 byte is needed for the address. The processor automatically
  fills the 00 high byte.
  eg.  LDA $F4
       $A5 $F4
  Note the different instruction codes for the different modes.
  Note also that for 2 byte addresses, the low byte is store first, eg.
  LDA $31F6 is stored as three bytes in memory, $AD $F6 $31.
  Zero-page absolute is usually just called zero-page.

  4) Implied
  No operand addresses are required for this mode. They are implied by the
  instruction.
  eg.  TAX - (transfer accumulator contents to X-register)
       $AA

  5) Accumulator
  In this mode the instruction operates on data in the accumulator, so no
  operands are needed.
  eg.  LSR - logical bit shift right
       $4A

  6 & 7) Indexed and Zero-page Indexed
  In these modes the address given is added to the value in either the X or
  Y index register to give the actual address of the operand.
  eg.  LDA $31F6, Y
       $D9 $31F6
       LDA $31F6, X
       $DD $31F6
  Note that the different operation codes determine the index register used.
  In the zero-page version, you should note that the X and Y registers are
  not interchangeable. Most instructions which can be used with zero-page
  indexing do so with X only.
  eg.  LDA $20, X
       $B5 $20

  8) Indirect
  This mode applies only to the JMP instruction - JuMP to new location. It is
  indicated by parenthesis around the operand. The operand is the address of
  the bytes whose value is the new location.
  eg.  JMP ($215F)
  Assume the following -        byte      value
                                $215F     $76
                                $2160     $30
  This instruction takes the value of bytes $215F, $2160 and uses that as the
  address to jump to - i.e. $3076 (remember that addresses are stored with
  low byte first).

  9) Pre-indexed indirect
  In this mode a zer0-page address is added to the contents of the X-register
  to give the address of the bytes holding the address of the operand. The
  indirection is indicated by parenthesis in assembly language.
  eg.  LDA ($3E, X)
       $A1 $3E
  Assume the following -        byte      value
                                X-reg.    $05
                                $0043     $15
                                $0044     $24
                                $2415     $6E

  Then the instruction is executed by:
  (i)   adding $3E and $05 = $0043
  (ii)  getting address contained in bytes $0043, $0044 = $2415
  (iii) loading contents of $2415 - i.e. $6E - into accumulator

  Note a) When adding the 1-byte address and the X-register, wrap around
          addition is used - i.e. the sum is always a zero-page address.
          eg. FF + 2 = 0001 not 0101 as you might expect.
          DON'T FORGET THIS WHEN EMULATING THIS MODE.
       b) Only the X register is used in this mode.

  10) Post-indexed indirect
  In this mode the contents of a zero-page address (and the following byte)
  give the indirect addressm which is added to the contents of the Y-register
  to yield the actual address of the operand. Again, inassembly language,
  the instruction is indicated by parenthesis.
  eg.  LDA ($4C), Y
  Note that the parenthesis are only around the 2nd byte of the instruction
  since it is the part that does the indirection.
  Assume the following -        byte       value
                                $004C      $00
                                $004D      $21
                                Y-reg.     $05
                                $2105      $6D
  Then the instruction above executes by:
  (i)   getting the address in bytes $4C, $4D = $2100
  (ii)  adding the contents of the Y-register = $2105
  (111) loading the contents of the byte $2105 - i.e. $6D into the
        accumulator.
  Note: only the Y-register is used in this mode.

  11) Relative
  This mode is used with Branch-on-Condition instructions. It is probably
  the mode you will use most often. A 1 byte value is added to the program
  counter, and the program continues execution from that address. The 1
  byte number is treated as a signed number - i.e. if bit 7 is 1, the number
  given byt bits 0-6 is negative; if bit 7 is 0, the number is positive. This
  enables a branch displacement of up to 127 bytes in either direction.
  eg  bit no.  7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0    signed value          unsigned value
      value    1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1    -39                   $A7
      value    0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1    +39                   $27
  Instruction example:
    BEQ $A7
    $F0 $A7
  This instruction will check the zero status bit. If it is set, 39 decimal
  will be subtracted from the program counter and execution continues from
  that address. If the zero status bit is not set, execution continues from
  the following instruction.
  Notes:  a) The program counter points to the start of the instruction
  after the branch instruction before the branch displacement is added.
  Remember to take this into account when calculating displacements.
          b) Branch-on-condition instructions work by checking the relevant
  status bits in the status register. Make sure that they have been set or
  unset as you want them. This is often done using a CMP instruction.
          c) If you find you need to branch further than 127 bytes, use the
  opposite branch-on-condition and a JMP.

INSTRUCTION OPERATION

 The following code has been taken from VICE for the purposes of showing
how each instruction operates. No particular addressing mode is used since
we only wish to see the operation of the instruction itself. 

     src : the byte of data that is being addressed.
     SET_SIGN : sets\resets the sign flag depending on bit 7.
     SET_ZERO : sets\resets the zero flag depending on whether the result
                is zero or not.
     SET_CARRY(condition) : if the condition has a non-zero value then the
                carry flag is set, else it is reset.
     SET_OVERFLOW(condition) : if the condition is true then the overflow
                flag is set, else it is reset.
     SET_INTERRUPT :  }
     SET_BREAK :      }  As for SET_CARRY and SET_OVERFLOW.
     SET_DECIMAL :    }
     REL_ADDR(PC, src) : returns the relative address obtained by adding
                the displacement src to the PC.
     SET_SR : set the Program Status Register to the value given.
     GET_SR : get the value of the Program Status Register.
     PULL : Pull a byte off the stack.
     PUSH : Push a byte onto the stack.
     LOAD : Get a byte from the memory address.
     STORE : Store a byte in a memory address.
     IF_CARRY, IF_OVERFLOW, IF_SIGN, IF_ZERO etc : Returns true if the
                relevant flag is set, otherwise returns false.
     clk : the number of cycles an instruction takes. This is shown below
                in situations where the number of cycles changes depending
                on the result of the instruction (eg. Branching instructions).
